Hello â€” I am a senior majoring in Statistics and Political Economy & minoring in Data Science; I like to read the news, watch YouTube videos, listen to rock and electronic music, mediate, lift weights, and do boxing in my free time. Hope you all will enjoy the course, and always feel free to reach out!
