Calculus and Linear Algebra . Note: None of these resources are meant to be a substitute for the appropriate requirement / co-requisite (Math 54, etc.). If you have no familiarity whatsoever with either of these topics, these may not be adequate and we strongly recommend spending time covering the prerequisite material yourself. We will assume that you have prior knowledge of these requirements and that these resources are simply to refresh your memory of concepts that you have previously learned. Please reach out to staff if you have any questions or concerns about this. Calculus: In terms of calculus, you will need to know a few things, most of which are covered within the space of the first homework and lab. Specifically, you will need to know univariate calculus rules like: Taking derivatives of a univariate function (i.e. f(x), where x is the only variable); Derivative power rule; Knowing derivatives of mathematical functions like: sinx,cosx,logx,ex; Chain rule; Product rule (rarely); Derivatives of sums. We will expect some multivariate fluency like: Taking partial derivatives of a multivariate function (i.e. f(x,y,z), where x,y,z are all variables); Gradients (the concept). | Khan Academy: Derivatives, Definitions, and Basic Rules; Multivariable Derivatives . | Math 53: Derivatives of Vector Functions . | .

    "content": "Your well-being matters, and we hope that Data 100 is never a barrier to taking care of your mental and physical health. Below are some campus resources that may be helpful. COVID-19 Resources and Support . You can find UC Berkeley’ COVID-19 resources and support here. For academic performance, support, and technology . The Center for Access to Engineering Excellence (Bechtel Engineering Center 227) is an inclusive center that offers study spaces, nutritious snacks, and tutoring in &gt;50 courses for Berkeley engineers and other majors across campus. The Center also offers a wide range of professional development, leadership, and wellness programs, and loans iclickers, laptops, and professional attire for interviews. As the primary academic support service for undergraduates at UC Berkeley, the Student Learning Center (510-642-7332) assists students in transitioning to Cal, navigating the academic terrain, creating networks of resources, and achieving academic, personal, and professional goals. Through various services including tutoring, study groups, workshops, and courses, SLC supports undergraduate students in Biological and Physical Sciences, Business Administration, Computer Science, Economics, Mathematics, Social Sciences, Statistics, Study Strategies, and Writing. The Educational Opportunity Program (EOP, Cesar Chavez Student Center 119; 510-642-7224) at Cal has provided first generation and low income college students with the guidance and resources necessary to succeed at the best public university in the world. EOP’s individualized academic counseling, support services, and extensive campus referral network help students develop the unique gifts and talents they each bring to the university while empowering them to achieve. Students can access device lending options through the Student Technology Equity Program (STEP) program. For mental well-being . The staff of the UHS Counseling and Psychological Services (Tang Center, 2222 Bancroft Way; 510-642-9494; for after-hours support, please call the 24/7 line at 855-817-5667) provides confidential, brief counseling and crisis intervention to students with personal, academic and career stress. Services are provided by a multicultural group of professional counselors including psychologists, social workers, and advanced level trainees. All undergraduate and graduate students are eligible for CAPS services, regardless of insurance coverage. To improve access for engineering students, a licensed psychologist from the Tang Center also holds walk-in appointments for confidential counseling in Bechtel Engineering Center 241 (check here for schedule). For disability accommodations . The Disabled Students’ Program (DSP, 260 César Chávez Student Center #4250; 510-642-0518) serves students with disabilities of all kinds, including mobility impairments, blind or low vision, deaf or hard of hearing; chronic illnesses (chronic pain, repetitive strain injuries, brain injuries, AIDS/HIV, cancer, etc.) psychological disabilities (bipolar disorder, severe anxiety or depression, etc.), Attention Deficit Disorder/Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, and Learning Disabilities. Services are individually designed and based on the specific needs of each student as identified by DSP’s Specialists. The Program’s official website includes information on DSP staff, UCB’s disabilities policy, application procedures, campus access guides for most university buildings, and portals for students and faculty. For solving a dispute . The Ombudsperson for Students (Sproul Hall 102; 510-642-5754) provides a confidential service for students involved in a University-related problem (academic or administrative), acting as a neutral complaint resolver and not as an advocate for any of the parties involved in a dispute. The Ombudsperson can provide information on policies and procedures affecting students, facilitate students’ contact with services able to assist in resolving the problem, and assist students in complaints concerning improper application of University policies or procedures. All matters referred to this office are held in strict confidence. The only exceptions, at the sole discretion of the Ombudsperson, are cases where there appears to be imminent threat of serious harm. The Student Advocate’s Office (SAO) is an executive, non-partisan office of the ASUC. We offer free, confidential casework services and resources to any student(s) navigating issues with the University, including academic, conduct, financial aid, and grievance concerns. All support is centered around students and aims for an equity-based approach. For recovery from sexual harassment or sexual assault . The Care Line (510-643-2005) is a 24/7, confidential, free, campus-based resource for urgent support around sexual assault, sexual harassment, interpersonal violence, stalking, and invasion of sexual privacy. The Care Line will connect you with a confidential advocate for trauma-informed crisis support including time-sensitive information, securing urgent safety resources, and accompaniment to medical care or reporting. For social services . Social Services provides confidential services and counseling to help students with managing problems that can emerge from illness such as financial, academic, legal, family concerns, and more. They specialize in helping students with pregnancy resources and referrals; alcohol/drug problems related to one’s own or a family member’s use; sexual assault/rape; relationship or other violence; and support for health concerns-new diagnoses or ongoing conditions. Social Services staff will assess a student’s immediate needs, work with the student to develop a plan to meet those needs, and facilitate arrangements with academic departments and advocate for the student with other campus offices and community agencies, as well as coordinate services within UHS. For finding community on campus . The mission of the Berkeley International Office (2299 Piedmont Avenue, 510-642-2818) is to provide support with all the essential resources needed to not only survive, but thrive here at UC Berkeley. Their mission is to support you and work together towards justice and belonging for all. They define Basic Needs as the essential resources that impact your health, belonging, persistence, and overall well being. It is an ecosystem that includes: nutritious food, stable housing, hygiene, transportation, healthcare, mental wellness, financial sustainability, sleep, and emergency dependent services. They refuse to accept hunger, homelessness, and all other basic needs injustices as part of our university. The Gender Equity Resource Center, fondly referred to as GenEq, is a UC Berkeley campus community center committed to fostering an inclusive Cal experience for all. GenEq is the campus location where students, faculty, staff and Alumni connect for resources, services, education and leadership programs related to gender and sexuality. The programs and services of the Gender Equity Resource Center are focused into four key areas: women; lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT); sexual and dating violence; and hate crimes and bias driven incidents. GenEq strives to provide a space for respectful dialogue about sexuality and gender; illuminate the interrelationship of sexism, homophobia and gender bias and violence; create a campus free of violence and hate; provide leadership opportunities; advocate on behalf of survivors of sexual, hate, dating and gender violence; foster a community of women and LGBT leaders; and be a portal to campus and community resources on LGBT, Women, and the many intersections of identity (e.g., race, class, ability, etc.). The Undocumented Students Program (119 Cesar Chavez Center; 642-7224) practices a holistic, multicultural and solution-focused approach that delivers individualized service for each student. The academic counseling, legal support, financial aid resources and extensive campus referral network provided by USP helps students develop the unique gifts and talents they each bring to the university, while empowering a sense of belonging. The program’s mission is to support the advancement of undocumented students within higher education and promote pathways for engaged scholarship. The Multicultural Education Program (MEP) is one of six initiatives funded by the Evelyn and Walter Haas, Jr. Fund to work towards institutional change and to create a positive campus climate for diversity. The MEP is a five-year initiative to establish a sustainable infrastructure for activities like educational consultation and diversity workshops for the campus that address both specific topics, and to cater to group needs across the campus. For basic needs (food, shelter, etc.) . The Basic Needs Center (lower level of MLK Student Union, Suite 72) provides support with all the essential resources needed to not only survive, but thrive here at UC Berkeley. Their mission is to support you and work together towards justice and belonging for all. They define Basic Needs as the essential resources that impact your health, belonging, persistence, and overall well being. It is an ecosystem that includes: nutritious food, stable housing, hygiene, transportation, healthcare, mental wellness, financial sustainability, sleep, and emergency dependent services. They refuse to accept hunger, homelessness, and all other basic needs injustices as part of our university. The UC Berkeley Food Pantry (#68 Martin Luther King Student Union) aims to reduce food insecurity among students and staff at UC Berkeley, especially the lack of nutritious food. Students and staff can visit the pantry as many times as they need and take as much as they need while being mindful that it is a shared resource. The pantry operates on a self-assessed need basis; there are no eligibility requirements. The pantry is not for students and staff who need supplemental snacking food, but rather, core food support.

    "title": "About Data 100",
    "content": "Combining data, computation, and inferential thinking, data science is redefining how people and organizations solve challenging problems and understand their world. This intermediate level class bridges between Data 8 and upper division computer science and statistics courses as well as methods courses in other fields. In this class, we explore key areas of data science including question formulation, data collection and cleaning, visualization, statistical inference, predictive modeling, and decision making.​ Through a strong emphasis on data centric computing, quantitative critical thinking, and exploratory data analysis, this class covers key principles and techniques of data science. These include languages for transforming, querying and analyzing data; algorithms for machine learning methods including regression, classification and clustering; principles behind creating informative data visualizations; statistical concepts of measurement error and prediction; and techniques for scalable data processing. Goals . | Prepare students for advanced Berkeley courses in data-management, machine learning, and statistics, by providing the necessary foundation and context. | Enable students to start careers as data scientists by providing experience working with real-world data, tools, and techniques. | Empower students to apply computational and inferential thinking to address real-world problems. | . Prerequisites . While we are working to make this class widely accessible, we currently require the following (or equivalent) prerequisites. Prerequisites will be enforced in Data 100. It is your responsibility to know the material in the prerequisites. The instructors do not have the authority to waive these requirements. Undergraduates should fill out the Enrollment Exception Form managed by CDSS to request an exception. | Foundations of Data Science: Data 8 covers much of the material in Data 100 but at an introductory level. Data 8 provides basic exposure to python programming and working with tabular data as well as visualization, statistics, and machine learning. | Computing: The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (CS 61A) or Computational Structures in Data Science (Data 88C). These courses provide additional background in python programming (e.g., for loops, lambdas, debugging, and complexity) that will enable Data 100 to focus more on the concepts in Data Science and less on the details of programming in python. | Math: Linear Algebra (Math 54, EE 16A, Math 91, Math 110, or Stat 89A): We will need some basic concepts like linear operators, eigenvectors, derivatives, and integrals to enable statistical inference and derive new prediction algorithms. This may be satisfied concurrently to Data 100. | . Please consult the Resources page for additional resources for reviewing prerequisite material. Textbook: There is no official textbook for Data 100 this semester; in its stead, we will provide course notes that will be released with the respective lectures. ",

    "title": "Course Culture",
    "content": "Students taking Data C100 come from a wide range of backgrounds. We hope to foster an inclusive and safe learning environment based on curiosity rather than competition. All members of the course community—the instructor, students, and GSIs—are expected to treat each other with courtesy and respect. Some of the responsibility for that lies with the staff, but a lot of it ultimately rests with you, the students. Be Aware of Your Actions . Sometimes, the little things add up to creating an unwelcoming culture to some students. For example, you and a friend may think you are sharing in a private joke about other races, majors, genders, abilities, cultures, etc. but this can have adverse effects on classmates who overhear it. There is a great deal of research on something called “stereotype threat”: research finds that simply reminding someone that they belong to a particular culture or share a particular identity (on whatever dimension) can interfere with their course performance. Stereotype threat works both ways: you can assume that a student will struggle based on who they appear to be, or you can assume that a student is doing great based on who they appear to be. Both are potentially harmful. Bear in mind that diversity has many facets, some of which are not visible. Your classmates may have medical conditions (physical or mental), personal situations (financial, family, etc.), or interests that aren’t common to most students in the course. Another aspect of professionalism is avoiding comments that (likely unintentionally) put down colleagues for situations they cannot control. Bragging in open space that an assignment is easy or “crazy,” for example, can send subtle cues that discourage classmates who are dealing with issues that you can’t see. Please take care, so we can create a class in which all students feel supported and respected. Be Respectful . Beyond the slips that many of us make unintentionally are a host of behaviors that the course staff, department, and university do not tolerate. These are generally classified under the term harassment; sexual harassment is a specific form that is governed by federal laws known as Title IX. UC Berkeley’s Title IX website provides many resources for understanding the terms, procedures, and policies around harassment. Make sure you are aware enough of these issues to avoid crossing a line in your interactions with other students. For example, repeatedly asking another student out on a date after they have said no can cross this line. Your reaction to this topic might be to laugh it off, or to make or think snide remarks about “political correctness” or jokes about consent or other things. You might think people just need to grow a thicker skin or learn to take a joke. This isn’t your decision to make. Research shows the consequences (emotional as well as physical) on people who experience harassment. When your behavior forces another student to focus on something other than their education, you have crossed a line. You have no right to take someone else’s education away from them. Communicate Issues with Course Staff and/or the Department . We take all complaints about unprofessional or discriminatory behavior seriously. Professionalism and respect for diversity are not just matters between students; they also apply to how the course staff treat the students. The staff of this course will treat you in a way that respects our differences. However, despite our best efforts, we might slip up, hopefully inadvertently. If you are concerned about classroom environment issues created by the staff or overall class dynamic, please feel free to talk to us about it. The instructors in particular welcome any comments or concerns regarding conduct of the course and the staff. See below for how to best reach us. From the Data Science Department: Data Science Undergraduate Studies faculty and staff are committed to creating a community where every person feels respected, included, and supported. We recognize that incidents may happen, sometimes unintentionally, that run counter to this goal. There are many things we can do to try to improve the climate for students, but we need to understand where the challenges lie. If you experience a remark, or disrespectful treatment, or if you feel you are being ignored, excluded or marginalized in a course or program-related activity, please speak up. Consider talking to your instructor, but you are also welcome to contact Executive Director Christina Teller at cpteller@berkeley.edu or report an incident anonymously through this online form. As course staff, we are committed to creating a learning environment welcoming of all students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences and respects your identities and backgrounds (including race, ethnicity, nationality, gender identity, socioeconomic class, sexual orientation, language, religion, ability, and more.) To help accomplish this: . | If your name and/or pronouns differ from those that appear in your official records, please let us know. | If you feel like your performance in the class is being affected by your experiences outside of class (e.g., family matters, current events), please don’t hesitate to come and talk with us. We want to be resources for you. | We (like many people) are still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to us about it. | While the course staff understands that improving diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) are not enough to overcome systemic issues in academia such as racism, queerphobia, and other forms of discrimination and hatred, we also recognize the importance of DEI work. | The Data Science Department has some resources available at https://data.berkeley.edu/about/diversity-equity-and-inclusion. | There’s also a great set of resources available at https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/students/grievances. | . | If there are other resources you think we should list here, let us know! | .

Lecture . There are 4 live lectures held Mondays to Thursdays, 5:00 pm - 6:30 pm, in-person in Li Ka Shing 245. All lecture recordings, slides, activities, and examples will be provided to the course website within 24 hours of the lecture. Discussion . Live discussion sections are one hour long sessions held twice weekly on Mondays and Wednesdays. The goal of these GSI-led sessions is to work through problems, hone your skills, and flesh out your understanding as part of a team. The problems that you solve and present as part of discussion are important in understanding course material. The lectures, assignments, and exams of this course are structured with the expectation that all students attend discussion. The content covered in these sections is designed to solidify understanding of key lecture concepts and prepare students for homework assignments. It is to your benefit to actively participate in all discussions! . | Discussion attendance will be recorded each week and account for 5% of the overall grade | All students are automatically granted 3 discussion drops to use for illness, personal emergencies, or other extenuating circumstances. These drops are designed to account for unexpected events – you should not plan to use them! | Students with low discussion attendance scores may alternatively shift this 5% of the course grade onto their homework score. Course staff will automatically determine which grading policy will maximize your final grade in the course at the end of the semester. | . You will be invited to share your timing preferences for discussions and assigned to a section in the first week of classes. Homework and Projects . Homeworks are half-week-long assignments designed to help students develop an in-depth understanding of both the theoretical and practical aspects of ideas presented in lecture. Projects are week-long assignments (with a half-week checkpoint) that synthesize multiple topics. Typically, assignments will be due at 11:59 pm on Mondays and Thursdays. | All homeworks and projects must be submitted to Gradescope by their posted deadlines. | Each assignment will include detailed instructions on how to submit your work for grading. It is the student’s responsibility to read these carefully and ensure that their work is submitted correctly. Assignment accommodations will not be granted in cases where students have mis-submitted their work (for example, by submitting to the wrong portal, submitting only part of an assignment, forgetting to select pages, or failing to pass autograder tests) | . | Homeworks and projects have both visible and hidden autograder tests. The visible tests are mainly sanity checks. For example, a sanity check might verify that the answer you entered is a number as expected, and not a word. The hidden tests generally check for correctness, and are invisible to students while they are doing the assignment. | The primary form of support students will have for homeworks and projects are office hours and Ed. | Homeworks and projects must be completed individually. See the Collaboration Policy for more details. | See the Policies section for the submission grace period. | . Lab . Labs are shorter programming assignments designed to give students familiarity with new ideas. They are meant to be completed prior to homework. Two lab assignments will be released at the start of each week, covering content that will be presented in that week’s lectures. The first of these two assignments will cover the content presented in Monday’s and Tuesday’s lectures; the second will cover the content presented in Wednesday’s and Thursday’s lectures. Both weekly lab assignments are due at 11:59 pm on the Saturday of the corresponding week. | All lab assignments must be submitted to Gradescope by their posted deadlines. | All lab autograder tests are visible. Receiving full points on the autograder guarantees that you will be awarded full points on the lab assignment. | All lab assignments will be accompanied by a video walkthrough with explanations of key concepts. There will be no synchronous lab sections, however, students are welcome to bring questions about lab to office hours. | All labs are intended to take about an hour. | . Exams . There will be two exams in this course: . | Midterm on Thursday, July 20 5-7 PM. | Final on Thursday, August 10 5-7 PM. | . All exams must be taken in-person.

Course staff will automatically apply whichever grading policy will maximize your final grade in the course at the end of the semester. On-Time Submission . All assignments are due at 11:59 PM Pacific Time on the due date specified on the Home / Schedule page. The date and time of this deadline are firm. Submitting even a minute past is considered late. Submitting by this “on-time” deadline earns an extra-credit on-time bonus, a 3% perk. This is available for homeworks, projects, and labs. Grace Period . We recognize that life can be unexpected, and that you may face circumstances that prevent you from submitting your work by the posted deadline. In light of this, we offer a 1-day (24 hour) grace period for late submissions of homeworks, projects, and labs.Note that this grace period is designed to account for unexpected emergencies or assignment submission errors – you should not plan in advance to use it! . You can make a late submission after the on-time deadline and up to the end of the grace period. These late submissions are not penalized, but do not earn 3% the on-time bonus. You do not need to explicitly contact staff about late submissions; just submit directly to Gradescope within the listed grace period. Submissions are not accepted beyond the grace period. The grace period is strictly enforced. We recommend thinking of the grace period as a backup, in case something unexpected comes up when aiming for the on-time deadline. As a result, getting an extension beyond the grace period will generally not be granted, except in rare, extraordinary emergencies (see the Extenuating Circumstances section). All official communication will refer to the on-time deadline as the expected dates that you will submit assignments. Extenuating Circumstances . We recognize that our students come from varied backgrounds and have widely-varying experiences. If you encounter extenuating circumstances at any time in the semester, please do not hesitate to let us know. The sooner we are made aware, the more options we have available to us to help you. The Extenuating Circumstances Form is for any circumstances that cannot be resolved via the grace period policy above. Within two business days of filling out the form, a course staff will reach out to you and provide a space for conversation, as well as to arrange course/grading accommodations as necessary. For more information, please email data100.support@berkeley.edu. We recognize that at times, it can be difficult to manage your course performance—particularly in such a huge course, and particularly at Berkeley’s high standards. Sometimes emergencies just come up (personal health emergency, family emergency, etc.). Our Grace Period Policy combined with the Extenuating Circumstances Form is meant to lower the barrier to reaching out to us, as well as build your independence in managing your academic career long-term. So please do not hesitate to reach out. Note that extenuating circumstances do not extend to logistical oversight, such as Datahub/Gradescope tests not passing, submitting only one portion of the homework, forgetting to save your notebook before exporting, submitting to the wrong assignment portal, or not properly tagging pages on Gradescope. It is the student’s responsibility to identify and resolve these issues in advance of the on-time deadline. We will not grant accommodations for these cases; instead, please use the grace period to cushion these submission errors. DSP Accommodations . If you are registered with the Disabled Students’ Program (DSP) you can expect to receive an email from us during the first week of classes confirming your accommodations. Otherwise, email our support email. DSP students who receive approved assignment accommodations will have the 1-day grace period added to the approved extension to the on-time deadline. Please note that any extension, plus the grace period combined, cannot exceed 5 days. DSP students can submit assignment extension accommodation requests via the Extenuating Circumstances Form. You are responsible for reasonable communication with course staff. If you make a request close to the deadline, we can not guarantee that you will receive a response before the deadline. Additionally, simply submitting a request does not guarantee you will receive an extension. Even if your work is incomplete, please submit before the deadline so you can receive credit for the work you did complete. Regrade Requests . Students will be allowed to submit regrade requests for the autograded and written portions of assignments in cases in which the rubric was incorrectly applied or the autograder scored their submission incorrectly. Regrades for the written portions of assignments will be handled through Gradescope, and autograder regrades via a Google Form. The deadline for regrade requests (autograded and written) is one week after grades are released for the corresponding assignment. Always check that the autograder executes correctly! Gradescope will show you the output of the public tests, and you should see the same results as you did on DataHub. If you see a discrepancy, ensure that you have exported the assignment correctly and, if there is still an issue, post on Ed as soon as possible. Regrade requests will not be considered in cases in which: . | a student uploads the incorrect file to the autograder. | the autograder fails to execute and the student does not notify the course staff before the assignment deadline. | a student fails to save their notebook before exporting and uploads an old version to the autograder. | a situation arises in which the course staff cannot ensure that the student’s work was done before the assignment deadline. | . Collaboration Policy and Academic Honesty . We will be following the EECS departmental policy on Academic Honesty, which states that using work or resources that are not your own or not permitted by the course may lead to disciplinary actions, including a failing grade in the course. Assignments. Data science is a collaborative activity. While you may talk with others about the homework and projects, we ask that you write your solutions individually in your own words. If you do discuss the assignments with others please include their names at the top of your notebook. Restated, you and your friends are encouraged to discuss course content and approaches to problem-solving, but you are not allowed to share your code nor answers with other students, nor are you allowed to post your assignment solutions publicly. Doing so is considered academic misconduct. We will be running advanced plagiarism detection programs on all assignments. Use of AI-assisted methods, such as ChatGPT, to generate written or code solutions to assignments is prohibited. Exams. Cheating on exams is a serious offense. We have methods of detecting cheating on exams – so don’t do it! Students caught cheating on any exam will fail this course. Plagiarism on any assignment, as well as other violations to Berkeley’s Code of Conduct, will be reported to the Center for Student Conduct. The CSC treats most first-time offenses as a Non-Reportable Warning. Additionally we reserve the right to give you a negative full score (-100%) or lower on the assignments in question, an F in the course, or even dismissal from the university. It’s just not worth it! . Rather than copying someone else’s work, ask for help. You are not alone in Data 100! The entire staff is here to help you succeed. We expect that you will work with integrity and with respect for other members of the class, just as the course staff will work with integrity and with respect for you. Finally, know that it’s normal to struggle. Berkeley has high standards, which is one of the reasons its degrees are valued. Everyone struggles, even though many try not to show it. Even if you don’t learn everything that’s being covered, you’ll be able to build on what you do learn, whereas if you cheat you’ll have nothing to build on. You aren’t expected to be perfect; it’s ok not to get an A. ",
